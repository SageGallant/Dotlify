# Dotlify - Email Alias Generator

Dotlify is a powerful tool for generating thousands of email aliases from a single email address. This project helps users create and manage email aliases using various methods (dot, plus, and domain variants).

## Features

- **Multiple Alias Methods**: Generate aliases using the dot method, plus method, domain alternatives, and combinations
- **Fast Generation**: Create thousands of aliases in seconds
- **Filter Options**: Show/hide different alias types
- **Easy Export**: Download aliases in TXT, CSV, Excel, or PDF formats
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Click any alias to copy it instantly
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Choose your preferred theme
- **Pagination**: Browse through large sets of aliases with ease

## Alias Methods Explained

1. **Dot Method**: Gmail ignores dots in the username, so `john.doe@gmail.com` and `johndoe@gmail.com` deliver to the same inbox. Dotlify generates all valid dot combinations.

2. **Plus Method**: Most email providers allow a plus (+) suffix in the username, like `johndoe+shopping@gmail.com`. This forwards to your main address while letting you track its use.

3. **Domain Aliases**: Some providers have alternative domains that deliver to the same inbox (e.g., gmail.com â†’ googlemail.com).

4. **Combined Methods**: Applying multiple methods together for maximum flexibility.

## Usage

1. Enter your email address
2. Click "Generate"
